;;; breed-back.lisp --- breed back with the original to correct optimize bugs

;; Copyright (C) 2013  Eric Schulte

;;; Commentary:

;; This file combines optimized versions of the benchmark with the
;; original in a mixed population.  This population is then evolved
;; against a mixture of held-out tests and the original optimization
;; workload.  The goal is to find a version which is both widely
;; correct and efficient.

;;; Code:

(defvar orig-energy 668.3218)
(defvar opt-energy 601.47565)
