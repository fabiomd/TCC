;;; Commentary:

;; Load this file with the -C option to define two energy model
;; fitness functions.  These models were trained against a Intel i7
;; machine with 4 physical cores, hyper-threading and 8G of memory,
;; and against an AMD Opteron machine with 48 cores and 120G of
;; memory.

;;; Code:
(in-package :goa)

;;; Models
;; TODO: these should probably either use cycles or seconds, not both
