 Minimize the genetic differences between ORIGINAL and NEW as
 much as possible such that TEST-SCRIPT continues to show a
 phenotypic difference between the two.

TEST-SCRIPT:
  Command line used to evaluate executables.  If the test
  script contains the substring \"~~a\" it will be replaced
  with the name of the executable, otherwise the executable
  will be appended to the end of the test script.

ORIG.store:
  A cl-store file holding the original version of the program.

NEW.store:
  A cl-store file holding the new version of the program.

Options:
 -h,--help ------------- print this help message and exit
 -o,--out FILE --------- write results to FILE
 -p,--patch ------------ return an assembly patch
 -f,--fit-func FLAGS --- fitness function
                         default: output of TEST-SCRIPT
 -a,--alpha ------------ maximum significance (default ~d)
 -r,--reps NUM --------- run objects NUM times (default ~d)
